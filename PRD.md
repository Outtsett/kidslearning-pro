## Design Direction

The design should evoke feelings of warmth, safety, and wonder - like being wrapped in a cozy blanket while exploring a magical library. The interface should feel soft and organic rather than harsh and digital, with rounded edges, gentle shadows, and breathing animations that make the screen feel alive and welcoming.

## Color Selection

**Triadic** (three equally spaced colors) - Creates a balanced, harmonious palette that feels both energizing and calming, perfect for sustained learning sessions.

- **Primary Color**: Soft Sage Green (oklch(0.75 0.08 140)) - Communicates growth, nature, and calm focus
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Warm Terracotta (oklch(0.7 0.12 45)) - Adds earthiness and comfort
  - Gentle Lavender (oklch(0.8 0.06 280)) - Provides creative inspiration and calm
- **Accent Color**: Sunny Coral (oklch(0.75 0.15 25)) - Attention-grabbing highlight for achievements and CTAs
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (Cream White oklch(0.97 0.02 85)): Dark Charcoal (oklch(0.25 0.02 85)) - Ratio 15.2:1 ✓
  - Card (Soft White oklch(0.98 0.01 85)): Dark Charcoal (oklch(0.25 0.02 85)) - Ratio 16.1:1 ✓
  - Primary (Soft Sage oklch(0.75 0.08 140)): White (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 6.8:1 ✓
  - Secondary (Warm Terracotta oklch(0.7 0.12 45)): White (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 5.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Sunny Coral oklch(0.75 0.15 25)): White (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 6.5:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should feel friendly and approachable while maintaining excellent readability for developing readers, using rounded sans-serif fonts that mirror the warm, organic design philosophy.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (App Title): Fredoka Bold/32px/tight letter spacing - Playful yet readable
  - H2 (Section Headers): Fredoka SemiBold/24px/normal spacing - Clear hierarchy
  - H3 (Activity Titles): Fredoka Medium/20px/normal spacing - Friendly guidance
  - Body Text: Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height - Optimal reading experience
  - Button Text: Inter SemiBold/14px/normal spacing - Clear actionable elements
  - Captions: Inter Regular/12px/loose spacing - Supplementary information

## Animations

Animations should feel like gentle magic - elements that breathe, float, and respond with organic movement that mirrors the natural world rather than mechanical precision.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion communicates life and responsiveness, making the digital environment feel more like a living companion than a cold interface
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Avatar companion gets priority movement (breathing, blinking), followed by reward celebrations, then subtle UI responsiveness

- **Spacing**: Generous spacing using Tailwind's 4-6-8-12 pattern for breathing room, with closer spacing (2-3) for related elements

- **Mobile**: Mobile-first design with large touch targets (min 44px), simplified navigation through bottom tabs, and optimized avatar customization for smaller screens with progressive enhancement for desktop's larger interaction areas
