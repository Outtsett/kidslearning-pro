# Progressive Difficulty Adjustment System

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive adaptive learning system that automatically adjusts difficulty based on child performance across all subjects (Math, Reading, Science, Art).

## Key Features

### 1. Performance Tracking
- **Detailed Metrics**: Tracks accuracy, response time, concept mastery, and learning patterns
- **Subject-Specific Analysis**: Individual performance tracking for each subject
- **Concept Mapping**: Identifies specific concepts the child has mastered vs. struggling with
- **Streak Tracking**: Monitors learning momentum and consistency

### 2. Adaptive Difficulty Engine
- **5-Level Progression**: Each subject has 5 difficulty levels with specific requirements
- **Age-Appropriate Caps**: 
  - Ages 3-5: Max Level 3
  - Ages 6-9: Max Level 4  
  - Ages 10-12: Max Level 5
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Automatically promotes or demotes difficulty based on performance patterns
- **Smart Requirements**: Requires sustained performance over multiple sessions before level changes

### 3. Personalized Adaptations
- **Hint System**: Shows/hides hints based on performance
- **Time Adjustments**: Extends time limits for struggling learners
- **Visual Support**: Adapts visual aids based on learning style and performance
- **Language Simplification**: Adjusts complexity of instructions for younger learners

### 4. Real-Time Feedback
- **Activity-Level Adaptation**: Each question can have individual time limits and difficulty
- **Immediate Adjustments**: System learns from each session and adjusts accordingly
- **Encouragement Engine**: Provides age-appropriate motivation based on performance trends

### 5. Comprehensive Analytics
- **Progress Insights Component**: Detailed view of learning progress and adaptive settings
- **Parent Dashboard Integration**: New "Adaptive" tab showing how system adjusts to child
- **Performance Trends**: Tracks improvement/decline patterns over time
- **Mastered vs. Struggling Concepts**: Clear visualization of learning progress
